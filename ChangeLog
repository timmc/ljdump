ChangeLog - ljdump

Version 2.0.0 - 2024-09-01

- Support (and require) Python 3
- Prompt for alternative server, defaulting to LJ
- Use "clear" auth method, since Dreamwidth has dropped challenge
  auth; the challenge method is incompatible with secure password
  handling on the server.
- Correspondingly, default all URLs to https: to protect passwords
  in transit.
- Bugfix: GUI was ignoring "journal" field
- Add --quiet option to suppress log messages
- Allow config file to omit password, in which case ljdump will
  prompt for it
- Environment variable LJDUMP_CONFIG_PATH allows reading config
  file from alternative path.
- Stable order of fields in XML output. (Tag order is still not
  stable, but that's coming as one string from the server.)
