ljdump - livejournal (or Dreamwidth) archiver

This program reads the journal entries from a livejournal (or compatible)
blog site and archives them in a subdirectory named after the journal name.

The simplest way to run this is to execute the ljdump.py script with Python.
Depending on your OS, you may be able to double-click the ljdump.py script
directly, or you may need to open a Terminal/Command Prompt window to run it.
Either way, it will prompt you for your Livejournal username and password,
then download all your journal entries, comments, and userpics.

You may optionally download entries from a different journal (a community)
where you are a member. If you are a community maintainer, you can also
download comments from the community.

If you want to save your username and password so you don't have to type
it every time you run ljdump, you can save it in the configuration file.

The configuration is read from "ljdump.config". A sample configuration is
provided in "ljdump.config.sample", which should be copied and then edited.
The configuration settings are:

  server - The XMLRPC server URL. This should only need to be changed
           if you are dumping a journal that is livejournal-compatible
           but is not livejournal itself.

  username - The livejournal user name. A subdirectory will be created
             with this same name to store the journal entries.

  password - The account password. This password is sent in the clear,
             so if you specify an alternative server, ensure you use
             a URL starting with https:// so the connection is encrypted.
             If not provided here, will prompt for it when run.

  journal - Optional: The journal to download entries from. If this is
            not specified, the "username" journal is downloaded. If this
            is specified, then only the named journals will be downloaded
            (this element may be specified more than once to download
            multiple journals).

This program may be run as often as needed to bring the backup copy up
to date. Both new and updated items are downloaded.
